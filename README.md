# Castle Shopper

Castle Shopper is an e-commerce site that enable users to rate, select and purchase their dream castles. Authenticated users will also be able to create, update and delete castle from their inventory. 

## Technology

Castle Shopper is written primarily in Javascript. We used ReactJS in combination with libraries such as React Redux and React Router. For the back end, PostgreSQL is a clear choice for sophisticated modeling, and safe and effective data storage and interaction. We also used ExpressJS for routing, and Mocha and Chai for unit testing.
