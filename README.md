# Castle Shopper

Castle Shopper is an e-commerce site that enables users to rate, select and bid for their dream castles. Authenticated users will also be able to create, update and delete castle from their inventories. 

## Technology

Castle Shopper is written primarily in Javascript. We chose ReactJS, an effective and modular framework for the front end, in combination with libraries such as React Redux and React Router. For the back end, PostgreSQL is a clear choice for sophisticated modeling, and safe and effective data storage and interaction. We also used ExpressJS for routing, and Mocha and Chai for unit testing.
